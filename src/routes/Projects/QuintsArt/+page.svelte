	projectDescription="This site was built (is being built) with SvelteKit, Tailwind, and GSAP. This is still a work in progress as I am currently waiting for the content, image files, logo, etc... What I have enjoyed most about this one so far is the incorporation of GSAP along with some new parallax ideas I have been playing with. The final result may look a little different but I think this is off to a good start."
